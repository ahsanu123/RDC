# RDC - Rust Driver Collection

**RDC** (Rust Driver Collection) is a modular and extensible collection of drivers for embedded devices written in pure Rust. All drivers are built on top of the [`embedded-hal`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal) traits, ensuring platform-agnostic support across various microcontrollers and embedded environments.

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ§© Modular drivers for various sensors, peripherals, and devices
- ðŸ”Œ Built using `embedded-hal` traits for portability
- ðŸ›  Designed to work in `no_std` environments
- ðŸ“¦ Easy integration with different hardware abstraction layers (HALs)
