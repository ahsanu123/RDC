# General Description

The MAX31865 is an easy-to-use resistance-to-digital
converter optimized for platinum resistance temperature
detectors (RTDs). An external resistor sets the sensitivity
for the RTD being used and a precision delta-sigma ADC
converts the ratio of the RTD resistance to the reference
resistance into digital form. The MAX31865’s inputs are
protected against overvoltage faults as large as Q45V.
Programmable detection of RTD and cable open and
short conditions is included.
