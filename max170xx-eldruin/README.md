This is a platform agnostic Rust driver for the ultra-compact, low-cost,
host-side fuel-gauge systems for lithium-ion (Li+) batteries in handheld
and portable equipment using the [`embedded-hal`] traits.

It is compatible with MAX17043, MAX17044, MAX17048, MAX17049, MAX17058 and MAX17059.

This driver allows you to:
- Get state of charge. See: `soc()`.
- Get battery voltage. See: `voltage()`.
- Software reset. See: `reset()`.
- Quickstart. See: `quickstart()`.
- Get IC version. See: `version()`.
- Only on MAX17048/MAX17049:
    - Get charge/discharge rate. See: `charge_rate()`.
- Only on MAX17048/MAX17049/MAX17058/MAX17059:
    - Set table registers. See: `set_table()`.

## The devices
The devices are ultra-compact, low-cost, host-side fuel-gauge systems
for lithium-ion (Li+) batteries in handheld and portable equipment.
There are models configured to operate with a single or dual lithium
cell pack.

The devices use a sophisticated Li+ battery-modeling scheme, called
ModelGauge(TM) to track the battery's relative state-of-charge (SOC)
continuously over a widely varying charge/discharge profile. Unlike
traditional fuel gauges, the ModelGauge algorithm eliminates the need
for battery relearn cycles and an external current-sense resistor.
Temperature compensation is possible in the application with minimal
interaction between a Î¼C and the device.

The communication is done through an I2C interface.

## Usage

To use this driver, import this crate and an `embedded_hal` implementation,
then instantiate the device.

Please find additional examples using hardware in this repository: [driver-examples]

```rust
use linux_embedded_hal::I2cdev;
use max170xx::Max17043;

fn main() {
    let dev = I2cdev::new("/dev/i2c-1").unwrap();
    let mut sensor = Max17043::new(dev);
    loop {
        let soc = sensor.soc().unwrap();
        let voltage = sensor.voltage().unwrap();
        println!("Charge: {:.2}%", soc);
        println!("Voltage: {:.2}V", voltage);
    }
}
```
